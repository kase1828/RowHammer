This is a demonstration of timing Cache Hit and Misses using a Pthread timer. The executable cache_time should print out the following:
(Cache Hit time),(Cache Miss time),(Miss-Hit) \n

Note, we expect the third column to be greater than zero.

To build, run the build_thresh script
The paralell_thresh script should build five times, each targeting a different core to execute on.
The V5out.txt file shows some example output data.

Increasing the number of cycles per execution (j>1) seems to cause an increase in reading latency. I'm still working on this problem...
